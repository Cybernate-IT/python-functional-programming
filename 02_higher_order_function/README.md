### Functions as First-Class Citizens

**Overview**

> This section focuses on the concept of treating functions as first-class citizens, exploring how functions can be manipulated as values, passed as arguments, and even returned from other functions.

**Topics Covered**

**Treating Functions as Values**

- Explanation of the concept of functions being first-class citizens.
- Treating functions as entities that can be assigned to variables and passed around.

**Passing Functions as Arguments**
- Demonstrating the ability to pass functions as arguments to other functions.
- Real-world scenarios where passing functions as arguments proves beneficial.

**Returning Functions from Other Functions**
- Illustration of functions returning other functions.
- Practical use cases where returning functions enhances code flexibility.

### Defining Higher-Order Functions

**Overview**

> This section delves into the characteristics and advantages of higher-order functions. It explores how functions can operate on other functions, leading to the power of functional composition.

**Topics Covered**

**Characteristics of Higher-Order Functions**

- Defining the characteristics that make a function a higher-order function.
Identifying patterns in higher-order functions.

**Leveraging Functions That Operate on Functions**

- Understanding how functions can operate on other functions.
- Practical examples of functions that manipulate or enhance other functions.

**Embracing the Power of Functional Composition**

- Introduction to functional composition as a powerful tool.
- Demonstrating how higher-order functions contribute to functional composition.
